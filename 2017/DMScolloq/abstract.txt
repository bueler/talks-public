TITLE:  Optimal solvers for partial differential equations

SPEAKER:  Ed Bueler

ABSTRACT:  Boundary value problems (BVPs) for partial differential equations (PDEs) are systems of equations in infinite dimensions.  For well-posed problems, any approximation scheme converts such a PDE into a system of N equations in N unknowns.  By definition, an "optimal solver" for such a system takes O(N) time.  It is easy to find optimal solvers for many 1D problems ... but those are actually ODEs and N is small in practice anyway.  For 2D and 3D problems, where N is commonly 10^6 or larger so as to achieve science/engineering goals, multigrid methods are the only general hope for optimality.  I'll describe this class of methods, considering linear and nonlinear BVPs, and then consider how to expand the "optimality" paradigm to initial/boundary problems, and to the context of parallel computing.  On modern computer hardware, which has large memory and is only sort-of-fast, the goal of optimality has practical and conceptual importance for scientific computations.  This talk is not really about new research, but it aims to expose this central thread of computational and applied mathematics.
