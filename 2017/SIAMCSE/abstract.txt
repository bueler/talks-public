title:  Implicit time-stepping for the cryosphere

abstract:  Coupled mass and momentum conservation problems for glaciers, subglacial liquid water, and sea ice are all characterized by multiple time scales and free boundaries.  In contrast to the fully-hyperbolic coupled evolution problems, which are typical of faster fluids, numerical momentum solutions in these slow-motion cases typically already require solving systems of equations, e.g. those representing Stokes flow.  However, current time-stepping schemes update geometry explicitly, using the (velocity) results of the momentum solve in the mass conservation equation.  Short time steps are then difficult to avoid, in part because of the free-boundary nature of the geometry updates.  This talk will explain this set of problems in thin-layer cases, and then address a variational inequality theory supporting such implicit time-stepping.  Numerical examples, including solver aspects and preconditioning, will be shown.
