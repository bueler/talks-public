* start with showing Ian's data

* describe model novelty:
  -- ssa as sliding law for sia
  -- show Schoof (2006) diagram and talk about advance over pre-determine streaming
  -- enthalpy method for polythermal: ease of implementation, under development
  -- till yield stress model:
    + pore water pressure model: need for few parameters
    + tillphi = f(bed)

* show 3km results: map-plane figs

* param study; histograms
