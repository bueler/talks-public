title: Kaczmarz iteration: A 21st century revival?

speaker: Ed Bueler

abstract: Iterative solver algorithms in linear algebra are a mainstream tool being applied to hard problems across all of mathematics.  By contrast, Kaczmarz iteration is a little-known algorithm which is geometrically-sweet and not very fast.  First I will contrast Kaczmarz iteration with better-known algorithms and then I will describe the revived 21st century interest in terms of connections to optimization and machine learning.  My introductory talk emphasizes the geometry, convergence, and history of the algorithm at an accessible level for anyone with a course in linear algebra.
