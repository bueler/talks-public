title:  Weak and shallow: New thinking about simulations of ice sheet flow

abstract:

The largest uncertainty in estimating sea level rise from climate warming is in the contribution from ice sheet dynamics.  Ice sheets are just big glaciers.  They are gravity-driven, slow (Stokesian), non-Newtonian, and contact-slipping flows.  Because they have small thickness-over-width aspect ratio, effective simulations use a selection of shallow approximations.

Basic questions about these models, like well-posedness, steady states, and good boundary conditions, are just now being asked and answered in mathematical ways.  For example, new work uses a weak formulation, specifically a variational inequality, to show existence for the best-established non-sliding shallow model.  Another recently-derived variational inequality describes where ice streams arise in a marine ice sheet.  Even conservation of energy for flowing glacier ice gives a free-boundary problem; that needs a weak formulation too.  I'll show a finite element method which combines these weak and shallow viewpoints and addresses the sea-level-critical situation in which there is a moving "grounding line" between land-based and floating ice.  Results in this talk are joint work with Guillaume Jouvet (Free University Berlin), but I'll take a broad expository view of the topic.
