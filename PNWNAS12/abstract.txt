title:  Weak and shallow: New thinking on simulations of ice sheet flows\begin{comment}

abstract:

The largest uncertainty in the amount of sea level rise from climate warming is the contribution of the flow of ice sheets.  Models of these flows are interesting because basic questions like well-posedness, the computation of steady states, and proper boundary conditions are just now being asked and answered in mathematical ways.

Ice sheets and glaciers are gravity-driven, slow (Stokesian), non-Newtonian, contact-slipping, and small thickness-over-width aspect ratio (shallow) flows.  While mathematical models include the Stokes equations, practical and insightful simulations usually work with a selection of shallow approximations.  In 2005 a weak formulation explained when ice streams emerge from a global marine ice sheet problem.  Newer work shows existence for the best-established non-sliding shallow approximation.  Numerical schemes based on combining these views addresses the sea-level-critical situation in which the ``grounding line'' between land-based and floating ice can move.  Even the conservation of energy problem for flowing glacier ice has a free-boundary character which needs a weak formulation.

The research results in this talk are joint work with Guillaume Jouvet (Free University Berlin), but I'll mostly take a broader expository view of the problem.
