============

Materials and instructions for the talk *Weak and shallow: New thinking about simulations of ice sheet flow* which I will give at the 27 October, 2012 Pacific Northwest Numerical Analysis Seminar in Boise, Idaho.

Note that "pdfanim.sty" is documented at http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~skupin/pdfanim/.

To make this stuff work you need Guillaume's materials for one of the animations; otherwise comment out the line in the .tex file:
